Shanta delivered a healthy baby girl on Monday, the 7th November, 2016 in Bangalore, India. Amara is our second daughter, and sister to Laaija Oinam.

As expected she had neonatal jaundice and needed a 48hr photo-therapy. She is OK now, back home after 5 days at the hospital.

Ever since Shanta got pregnant early this year in February, we chose and consulted with Dr. Ashwini GB of [Aspire Fertility](https://www.aspirefertility.in), HSR Layout, Bangalore. She guided and helped us through the pregnancy with care and empathy. She delivered Amara via elective cesarean. She helped us prepare confidently without any concerns. We are very happy with Dr. Ashwini and her team.
