Today was the the first day for Laaija. She was more than eager to go to School  - Roots to Wings - loves the fancy play-things around. The Swing was her favorite. She didn’t cry at all but instead was angry when we took her back home. We had to indulge her to another park and persuade her that she will be going to School again tomorrow.
